# First Post Here

Hi everyone, I believe introductions are in order. My name is Dempsey and this is my blog!!!
I guess you are probably wondering why would I make a blog and why make it custom instead of using some solution like everyone else. 

## Why make it custom?

I'm answering this question first as its the significantly shorter question to answer.

> Don't spend time reinventing the wheel

This is an amazing metaphor and an often useful one, but it is also occasionally used to criticise people building things when they don't need to. I think if you love spokes and rims, build all the wheels you like. You might even find a better wheel that we've all missed along the way to make things as efficiently as possible. 

So yeah, I'm here building a pretty basic blog website because at the moment I can only learn, hopefully soon I'll be able to give back a bit of knowledge I've gained but that's only helpful if I learn, hence working on this little section of the internet I've constructed as a both a product of passion and an exercise in learning.
 
With time, I hope this site grows to be more exciting for everyone and informative too.

## Why have a blog?

Unfortunately, my reasons for writing the blog ain't as honorable as the making it custom section. I began this project to stand out! Funny thing when almost every software engineer looking for a job has a blog. But by giving a voice and even an image to that abstract collection of facts named my CV I could appeal to someone out there.

Now that i'm done saying the quiet bit out loud, what's in it for you to continue. Well knowledge first and foremost. I will be filling this page with posts about the various fields of software engineer and technology I've encountered over the course of my *career*. This should include reviews of books, gadgets and technologies I'm trying out. Maybe the occasional post about music, movies or some other hobby I've picked up recently. 

Drop by every once in a while, it can't hurt to see what's going on.
