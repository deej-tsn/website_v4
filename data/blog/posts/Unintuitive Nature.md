# Unintuitive Nature Of Programming

Programming is generally considered by the public a difficult endeavour. In part due to all the abstractions disconnecting actions and underlying behaviour. These type of abstractions is found in many highly technical fields and a purposeful characteristic used to simplify use of the tools. We have even created whole fields around finding best ways to simplify (abstract away) the user's experiences. 

This is a great consideration we've made as a society, no person needs to be an expert to get some type of useful behaviour done. But it does have an expected negative side effect of removing some understanding of how the tools work. This side effect I like to call an *Unintuitive understanding* of the tools. It is not being obvious or not knowing as most people have a vague understanding. Websites get data from somewhere and show it to you. You plug in a charger and electricity flows from the socket to the battery. etc etc.

However, engaging in any such technical field is often a challenge of shredding these vague ideas and replacing them with the concrete implementations that such tools use. Unless we can reconstruct the tool from basic parts ,basic changing from field to field and tool to tool, I do not believe we can truly say we have completely shred assumptions for implementations; there will exists unknown unknown until you've gone through the whole process yourself. This is not a negative as we only have finite time and it is a costly task to learn the ins and outs of a complex tool.

How does all this relate to programming, well as programmers we interact with many layers of abstractions (See first 10 minutes of [MIT EE lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfQxyVuLeCs&list=PL9F74AFA03AA06A11)).
