# The Unintuitive Nature of Programming

Programming is often seen as a challenging endeavor, largely because abstractions obscure the connection between actions and their underlying mechanics. These abstractions, ubiquitous in highly technical fields, serve to simplify complex tools, making them more accessible to a broader audience. Entire industries have arisen around perfecting user-friendly designs to abstract away complexity.

This simplification has undeniable benefits: users no longer need to be experts to achieve meaningful outcomes. However, it also creates a natural trade-off—by hiding the inner workings of a tool, we inadvertently limit our understanding of it. I like to call this phenomenon an Abstracted Awareness: a surface-level grasp of how things function without truly understanding the intricate details beneath.

For instance, most people know that websites retrieve data and display it or that plugging in a charger makes electricity flow into a battery. But when it comes to explaining the how, vague notions replace concrete knowledge. Diving into any technical field requires dismantling these assumptions and replacing them with a solid understanding of the underlying systems. Yet, even this process has its limits—true mastery often demands reconstructing the tool from its basic components, a time-intensive and costly endeavor.

In programming, we face this challenge daily. Interacting with layers of abstraction—from high-level code to the operating system, the kernel, and the CPU—means we rarely understand every piece of the puzzle. This leaves us working with tools we may never fully grasp, from the behavior of our code as it interacts with the OS to the intricacies of hardware execution (for a deeper dive, see the first 10 minutes of this [MIT lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfQxyVuLeCs&list=PL9F74AFA03AA06A11)).

While we can’t eliminate these layers of abstraction, we can strive to balance efficiency with curiosity. By deliberately exploring lower levels of the stack, even incrementally, we gain insights that make us better problem-solvers. Programming may be unintuitive at its core, but it’s through embracing its complexities that we grow—not only as coders but as creators.
