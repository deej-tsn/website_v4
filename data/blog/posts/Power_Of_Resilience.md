# Power Of Resilience 

In a hopeless attempt to make this post not sound like a LinkedIn update from someone feigning experience and expertise, I’ll say upfront that I have not had much success in finding a job in software nor do I know how far I am from success in my current state. In spite of this, I’m writing this post to talk about the power of resilience and the value of making incremental progress.

Now, this is not general advice for every occasion—resilience is not always the right answer to an unfavourable situation. Most of the time, if you don’t like something, taking steps to avoid it in future is the smart move. However, when you’re confident that what you need lies on the other side of a hurdle, that’s when resilience truly shines as the powerful skill it is.

Sidenote: I want to focus on the internal conflict I've experienced during this period rather than the state of the industry. The state of the industry is an important factor that is well documented [elsewhere](https://medium.com/@aguimarneto/is-the-software-engineering-field-becoming-oversaturated-in-2023-5b57878b3ed5). Think of the industry as the mountain I've chosen to climb. Since I've chosen this mountain to climb, I can not pray the mountain disappear or hope it becomes less steep, I can only control how I make my way up the mountain - my mindset.


With that disclaimer out of the way, let us begin with a story of resilience.

## A Strong Start

Having a natural talent and love for Mathematics and adjacent fields involving problem-solving, I, lacking humility, often assumed success was guaranteed in my younger years. When I say "guaranteed," I don’t mean that good results would come no matter what I did, but that I could—and always would—do enough to achieve a 'good' result. A little trick I used to keep this illusion alive was to constantly move the goalposts; when "amazing" wasn’t achieved, suddenly doing "okay" despite minimal effort became a 'good' result.

I wouldn’t say I coasted through school entirely—my love for Mathematics and problem-solving kept me engaged and propelled me to keep learning new, exciting aspects of the subjects. However, when it came to topics that didn’t interest me, my belief in my ‘guaranteed’ success often led to procrastination and taking shortcuts.

I say all of this to set up the mindset with which I entered the battlefield of applying for entry-level software engineering roles: an optimistic yet naïve fresh university graduate in July 2023.

## Rude Awakening

Two distinctive and contradictory narratives were in every graduate and job seekers mind in 2023 surrounding Software Engineer:

1. Software engineering is a booming, well-paid industry with plenty of job security—just ignore the layoffs and keep applying.
2. Software engineering was great five years ago, but now it’s imploding. You’d be better off returning to university and doing something else with your talents.

Confident in my abilities, I chose to believe the first narrative—that everything would be okay. I threw myself into applications without much concern for the strength of my CV, my lack of internships, or my ability to interview well.

Unsurprisingly, I didn’t get off to a great start. Perhaps, in another time, I might have scraped by and landed a decent role, but the industry in 2023 was unforgiving. Giving it the bare minimum just wasn’t enough.

The following months could be summerised as a opportunity to become intimately familiar with all 5 stages of grief.

### Denial
It’s astonishing how long I held onto the illusion that a job was mine to have and that I only needed to wait. My lack of strong relationships with others in similar positions only prolonged this denial, allowing me to remain blissfully unaware of the scale of the industry’s challenges—or my relative weakness within it.

### Anger

As rejection emails and failed tests piled up, I began to realise I wasn’t going to join my contemporaries in exciting new office jobs and the benefits of adult life. Despite how this post might sound, I am fairly self-aware. I knew that my half-hearted approach to tasks I found uninteresting had contributed to my situation. This realisation led to nights of blaming myself and days of telling friends it was all the industry’s fault. At times, I even took pride in making it to the interview stages, given the odds. But deep down, it was anger—anger at being stuck in limbo while others moved forward.

### Bargaining

Being a problem solver at heart yet not completely free of my unwillingness to engage in the work of job applications,I threw myself into fixing the symptoms rather than the cause. This is not entirely a bad thing - it taught me a lot about the application process for software engineering roles. Fixing symptoms felt like progress, even when the cause remained elusive. 

I finally drafted a CV, polished my LinkedIn page, built a portfolio website, and even wrote a few cover letters (still not my favourite activity). I started reading programming books, practising through projects, LeetCode challenges, and tutorials. I dove into the field from an outsider’s perspective. Shoutout to [the Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen) for helping provide perspective and advice during this stage.

This was the beginning of resilience, though it was still the kind of resilience that relies on believing "just a little longer" will be enough. This belief faltered when reality proved otherwise.

### Depression

Having shed my unfounded confidence and put in the work, I thought I was entitled to success. But rejection still came, and it stung more than ever:

1. These rejections came deeper into the process, often in final stages. Weeks of preparation and emotional investment made each one feel like a heavier loss.
2. The lack of transparency in hiring processes was demoralising. Companies would invite you in, have you perform, then leave you waiting for weeks only to reject you—sometimes even misspelling your name.
3. I had done all that extra work without immediate success, exhausting all quick solutions also left me with the realisation that there are no easy answers left, only hopes and hard work.

Leaving me with a sense of placelessness, not sure where I was going wrong and where to go next to do better.  A cycle of thoughts plagued me — "I just want a job to learn and do great things" would spiral into "Why don’t they want me? What did I say wrong?". Each month and season passed, the end of the path seemed farther away.

A particularly low point came in October, when I reached the final stage of an application process. I had promised those around me that I would secure a job by the end of the year, and October felt like my last realistic chance. That rejection felt like I had let everyone down.

Periods like this strip you down to your core beliefs. There’s no room for false confidence in the face of repeated failure—only questions like Why am I doing this? and Is it worth it? This was a pivotal time for me. Confronting those questions directly, I realised that after stripping everything else away, I truly love problem-solving and programming.

That realisation helped lift me out of the sense of placelessness. It wasn’t that I didn’t know what I wanted—it was simply that what I wanted was taking longer than it had for others. So what if I missed the mark this year? So what if I’ve failed many times? Do those failures diminish my desire to be a software engineer? Do they mean I’m incapable of learning or succeeding?  

### Acceptance

Acceptance isn’t the end of the road. It’s not a moment of enlightenment or some profound insight that wipes away the pain of the other stages. That hasn’t been my experience, at least. Only landing a job could truly remove the immediate problem, and even then, it won’t mean freedom from challenges altogether.

Instead, acceptance is an acknowledgment that these stages—denial, anger, bargaining, and even depression—are part of the process. By going through them, I’ve confronted flaws in my mindset, technical abilities, and business acumen. University couldn’t have prepared me for all the challenges of adult life, but this journey has offered glimpses of those hardships to come. And for that, I’m oddly grateful.

That said, acceptance isn’t a static state. Even now, receiving a rejection email still stings and makes me question the point of it all. Every new idea to stand out could be seen as a form of bargaining—perhaps even this blog is bargaining in disguise &#128064;. 

This is where resilience (let’s get back on topic) truly comes into play. Setting my sights on software engineering meant I had to face each stage of grief head-on. Giving up was never an option for a dream this important. Along the way, I’ve developed the strength to survive rejection, critically examine my weaknesses, and improve independently. I’ve learned to look inward for motivation rather than outward for validation, to work hard for those supporting me, and to push forward despite doubts from myself or others.

Reflecting on everything I’ve done, I feel confident again—not in natural talent or sheer luck, but in my capacity to endure and grow. Surviving 1.5 years of job searching is, in itself, a testament to resilience and perseverance.

## What's Next

As I mentioned at the start, I don’t know where or when this journey will end. What I’ve learned, though, is to appreciate the small wins along the way—getting better at interviews, genuinely enjoying programming every day, and connecting with others in the profession to learn from their journeys. (By the way, if you’re in the area, come down to [freeCodeCamp LDN](https://freecodecamp.london/) for a chat!) Learning something new everyday, websockets and realtime communications next!

Whatever happens, I’ll keep going. With resilience, I’m confident that sooner rather than later, I’ll join the ranks of Software Engineers.

Until then, see you next time.
