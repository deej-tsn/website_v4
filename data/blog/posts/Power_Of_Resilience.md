# Power Of Resilience 

In a hopeless attempt to make this post not sound like a LinkedIn post from someone feigning experience and knowledge, I will say up front that I have not had much success in finding a job in software nor know how far I am from success in my current state. In spite of this, I am making this post to talk about the power of resilience and making incremental progress.

Now this is not general advice for every occasion, resilience is not often the right answer to an unfavourable situation. Most times, if you do not like something, making steps to not encounter that thing again is smart. But when you are confident that what you need is on the other side of this hurdle, thatâ€™s when resilience truly shines for the powerful skill it is.

With that disclaimer out the way, let us begin with a story of resilience.
